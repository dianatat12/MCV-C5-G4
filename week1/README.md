# C5-Project-Week 1 Introduction to Pytorch

We are group 4, composed of:
- Aleix Pujol - aleixpujolcv@gmail.com
- Diana Tat - dianatat120@gmail.com
- Georg Herodes - georgherodes99@gmail.com
- Gunjan Paul - gunjan.mtbpaul@gmail.com

Objective:
- Establish the PyTorch environment and implement the best Image Classification network model from the C3 course.

Collaborative Effort:
- We have worked in two distinct teams during the C3 course.
- We have chosen the best model from each team, initially implemented in Keras.

Implementation Process:
- Re-implemented and adapted the top-performing Keras models into PyTorch.
  
Evaluation Metrics:
- Computed loss graphs for meticulous analysis.
- Compared PyTorch loss results with those obtained from Keras.
  
Accuracy Assessment:
- Computed accuracy graphs to assess overall model performance.
- Conducted a detailed comparison of PyTorch accuracy results with benchmarks from Keras.

The code is organised as follow:
- Keras implementation of the Model 11 (the best model from C3) : train_tf.py
- PyTorch implementation of Model 11: train_torch.py
- PyTorch Lightening implementation of Model 11: train_lightning.py
