For the report we achieved compile timeout on Overleaf so we had to compile it locally on our computers. We have pushed the report in PDF format, as well as text files in the repository in the `report` directory.

### Week 4 Tasks:
#### Task (a): Implement basic Image-to-text retrieval.

  
#### Task (b): Implement basic Text-to-image retrieval.


#### Task (c): Use BERT embedding as Text feature extractor.
